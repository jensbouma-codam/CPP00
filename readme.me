# C++ Programming Language

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. It is widely used for developing system software, application software, device drivers, embedded software, and video games.

## The Orthodox Canonical Class Form

The Orthodox Canonical Class Form (OCCF) is a set of guidelines for designing C++ classes. Some of the key principles of OCCF include:

- Using a consistent naming convention for class members and methods
- Providing default constructors and destructors
- Avoiding global variables and functions
- Using const-correctness to prevent accidental modification of objects
- Following the Rule of Three (or Five) to ensure proper memory management

Overall, the goal of OCCF is to promote good design practices and help developers create high-quality C++ code that is easy to understand, use, and maintain.
